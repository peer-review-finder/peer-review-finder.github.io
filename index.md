## Overview
The problem: Journal editors and conference chairs find it increasingly difficult to find reviewers for publication manuscripts. At the same time, researchers receive an overwhelming number of invitations to review papers.

The solution: We propose a platform that better matches papers for review with potential reviewers by pooling researchers with similar interests together. Editors/chairs can post abstracts in need of review and researchers can select abstracts of papers theyâ€™d like to review.
